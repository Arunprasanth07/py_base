#Arithmentic Operators

add = a + z # "+" Addition Operator
sub = a - z # "-" subtract Operator
multi = a * z # "*" Multiplication Operator
div = a / z # "/" Division Operator
div2 = a // z # "/" Division Operator only return the Quotient
mod = a % z # "%" Division Operator only return the Remainder
root = a**z # Square root value

#Relational Operators
